<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 1, 2026</p>

<p>
Talk with God (“the App”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information
is handled when you use the app.
</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<p>
The Talk with God app does <strong>not</strong> require users to create an account and does
<strong>not</strong> collect personally identifiable information such as your name, email address,
phone number, or physical address.
</p>

<p>
User-generated content (such as text entered into the app) is processed solely to provide the
core functionality of the app and is not sold or shared with third parties for advertising or
tracking purposes.
</p>

<h2>Use of Data</h2>

<p>
Any data processed by the app is used exclusively to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide app functionality</li>
  <li>Improve performance and reliability</li>
  <li>Support subscription access where applicable</li>
</ul>

<p>
We do not use your data for targeted advertising or behavioral tracking.
</p>

<h2>Subscriptions</h2>

<p>
Talk with God offers an optional auto-renewable subscription (“Talk with God Plus”).
Subscription purchases and management are handled entirely by Apple via the App Store.
We do not receive or store your payment information.
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>
The app may rely on Apple-provided services (such as StoreKit) and platform infrastructure
to operate. These services are governed by Apple’s own privacy policies.
</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>

<p>
Reasonable safeguards are used to protect the integrity and security of the app.
No method of electronic storage or transmission is completely secure, and absolute security
cannot be guaranteed.
</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>
The app does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.
If you believe such information has been provided inadvertently, please contact us so it can
be removed.
</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this
page with an updated effective date.
